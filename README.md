I started my career as an analyst in 2019 in Asegurarte group where I was mainly in charge of investigating credit card frauds in the deep web, that led me to write several posts about analysis methodologies and anonymity, in order to expose in the FliSol of Paran√°.

I also worked as a private investigator in several cases of identity theft and fraud.

In 2021 I started working as a SOC analyst at Acenture Group, where I monitored, analyzed, linked and categorized alerts using different sources provided by the company. Identify root causes by investigating the incident, compromising weak data and debugging network issues.

Analyze malware using technology and review logs, in order to decrypt fake authentication and conduct thorough incident investigations.

Create reports, graphs, summaries, metrics, dashboards and other operational support documents, such as use cases and incident metrics. Help direct appropriate remediation steps for network incidents and investigate and analyze threat intelligence and compromise metrics.

And that's why ... because of my solid experience, capabilities and accomplishments in the area of cybersecurity, I have no doubt that I will be able to successfully meet the demands of this position.
